# nxc-module-personal-repo
This repository contains modules for the netexec tool. These are modules for most of them we were not PR at netexec’s repo or we were refused. I make them available anyway because they are useful to me, so can they be useful to someone else? 

A big thank for the work of Netexec devs.

## Setup

```
⚠️ it’s modules have been tested in lab environments and rarely in production.
