This repository contains modules for the netexec tool. These are modules for most of them we were not PR at netexec’s repo or we were refused. I make them available anyway because they are useful to me, so can they be useful to someone else? 

A big thank for the work of Netexec devs.

Netexec repo : [https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec)
